# Three Seeds Tarot Application
Welcome to Three Seeds Tarot! This application is a prototype of something I would like to grow over time. The purpose of the application is to gain an insight into the world of Tarot through readings. 
## Using the App
Users can create a profile or login if they are returning.

Once a user has logged in, they can then choose to either browse the cards in order or choose from three types of readings.
```
Single Card Reading
Three Card Reading
Five Card Reading
```
During a reading, a user can click on a card to open up a guide to the meaning of the card. This feature isn't exclusive to the reading though. Anywhere a card is displayed, it can be clicked to see a description of that card.

Any reading that a user gets, is saved to their readings. These readings are all accessible from the "Readings" page that is linked to in the navigation bar at the top of the screen. Each of these readings is saved with the user's name and the datetime of the reading.
